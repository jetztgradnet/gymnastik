/**
 * A routing rule represents the forward or redirect part of a rule definition.
 * A default route is present, but alternative routes can be defined
 * depending on the status of a "capability", like DATAST0RE_WRITE, MEMCACHE, etc.,
 * whether that capability is ENABLED, DISABLED, SCHEDULED_MAINTANCE or UNKNOWN.
 * The order of the rules definitions is important,
 * as the first rule validated will be the one which will be followed.
